# es6-weak-map

## WeakMap collection as specified in ECMAScript6

_Roughly inspired by Mark Miller's and Kris Kowal's [WeakMap implementation](https://github.com/drses/weak-map)_.

Differences are:

-   Assumes compliant ES5 environment (no weird ES3 workarounds or hacks)
-   Well modularized CJS style
-   Based on one solution.

### Limitations

-   Will fail on non extensible objects provided as keys

### Installation

    $ npm install es6-weak-map
